Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until hot, then add the beef and fry until golden and crisp. Scoop out the beef and drain on kitchen paper. Pour away all but 1 tbsp oil. Bubble for 2 mins, then add the beef back to the pan and toss well to coat.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p><span id="sushi">Sushi</span>As the dietary staple of Japan, knowing how to cook Japanese rice is an important first step to becoming a Japanese cooking master. Perfectly prepared rice should be light, fluffy, and slightly sticky when cooked. In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.</p></div>
